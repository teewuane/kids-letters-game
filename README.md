Create a kids game to help them learn how to type and recognize letters on keyboard.

Show a letter on the screen. Show the upper and lower case letter.

Wait for input from the user. If the input matches the letter make something explode or do something cool.

If the input does not match the letter show, play a funny sound, keep the letter up there.

Keep showing random letters until they get 10 in a row correct. Then move them to the next level.
